# responsive-design

This is a portion of the Responsive Design project from The Odin Project. The goal is to model the responsive design elements of the website thenextweb.com.

As far as the responsive design goes, this project is essentially complete. As you scale your window down from full screen, it adjusts the size of the main article elements, the popular articles section, and changes the nav bar at the top from a set of visible links to a popup menu. Scaling the window down farther will change the sizing and layout of the Latest Stories section and cause the footer to stack on itself to save width while showing all of the content.

I did nothing with the appearance of this page beyond making every individual element distinct, so that it is obvious what piece of this site mirrors the piece on thenextweb.com. Additionally, they have a huge amount of stuff on their home page; I didn't feel like it was relevant to create several more sections to just set their responsive design the same as the sections that already exist on this page.
